## Course Description

This repository comprises projects from a graduate-level industrial engineering course, INDE 577: Data Science and Machine Learning, offered by Rice University in Spring 2024. The course focuses on the topics in data science and machine learning algorithms along with their Python-based applications. A distinguishing aspect of this course is its emphasis on constructing algorithms from scratch instead of relying on established packages. Through this approach, participants gain insights into the intuition behind algorithms, encompassing fundamental concepts, computational procedures, model formulation, and evaluation metrics.

Machine learning is the discipline concerned with comprehending and constructing techniques to glean insights from data, thereby enhancing performance on various tasks. It proves valuable in simplifying problems that necessitate extensive fine-tuning or lengthy rule sets, unraveling solutions to intricate problems, adapting to dynamic environments by incorporating new data, and managing vast datasets.

Some applications of machine learning include:

- Facilitating interaction: Incorporating chatbot natural language processing, image recognition, and speech recognition to enable applications to respond to voice commands.
- Tailoring experiences: Offering personalized recommendations, search results, notifications, and targeted advertisements.
- Detecting anomalies: Identifying instances of credit fraud, spam, fake news, and tumors.
- Offering insights: Analyzing and categorizing analytics in various ways, evaluating features, and summarizing documents.
- Generating content: Predicting future behavior to preload content and minimize wait times, visually representing high-dimensional data, and forecasting revenue.

This course uses the following data science tools:
- Python version 3.6 or higher
  - [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html)
  - [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)
  - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html)
  - [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html)
  - [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/all_symbols)

The topics covered in this course broadly fall into 2 categories:
